# Contributing to UNI

Thanks for looking. This is a small, opinionated project, so the fastest path is
short: read the constitution, run the tests, then pick something.

## What UNI is, in three sentences

UNI is the outcome assurance layer: a declarative contract says what must be
true, a trusted registry says how to prove it, verifiers produce evidence bound
to a revision, and a deterministic engine decides whether the result is
acceptable. No language model takes part in the path from verification to
decision. `constitution.md` is the twelve rules everything else answers to, and
`CONTEXT.md` is the glossary.

## Set up

```bash
git clone https://github.com/guillaume-flambard/uni-protocol
cd uni-protocol
cargo build --release
./target/release/uni verify examples/hello/hello.uni   # end to end, no network
cargo test
```

Before opening a pull request, run what CI runs:

```bash
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test
```

## The workflow worth knowing

Work is contract first, then proof. A change is done when a verifier proves it,
never when a description says so:

1. Write or edit the `.uni` contract (or an adapter, or a test).
2. Prove it: `uni verify <contract>`, then `uni explain`.
3. Open a pull request. The check in the pull request is the argument.

Two habits make review quick. First, a new behaviour gets a test at the level it
lives: the low crates (`uni-parser`, `uni-ir`, `uni-evidence`, `uni-verify`,
`uni-decision`) take unit tests beside the code, the CLI takes an integration
test under `crates/uni-cli/tests/`. Second, if a claim in prose is not backed by
a verifier, it does not belong in a document as a fact.

## House rules that are not negotiable

These come from the constitution, and a pull request that breaks one will be
asked to change even if it works:

- **Contracts are untrusted, the registry is trusted.** A contract may only name
  verifiers. Anything that lets a contract introduce a command, or lets a token
  be trusted from a URL fetched at runtime, is a security regression.
- **No inert semantics.** The vocabulary is closed. If a keyword is not
  implemented, it is a located hard error naming its line, never silently
  ignored text. `REJECT WHEN` and `ESCALATE WHEN` are reserved and must keep
  failing.
- **The decision stays deterministic.** Identical contract, evidence and policy
  must yield an identical decision. Nothing in the decision path reads the
  network, the clock, or randomness. The two clock reads that exist (evidence
  expiry, token `exp`) gate availability, not the verdict.
- **Evidence must fully cover what it claims.** Partial stdout, the wrong
  revision, the wrong environment, or an expired proof invalidates. If your
  change narrows what a verifier observes, say so in the pull request.

## Where help is most useful

Ordered by what unblocks the most:

- **A second multi-file study task.** `experiments/study-50/` is the harness, and
  `tasks/t11-fee-conservation/` is the shape to copy: a multi-file base, an owner
  invariant the worker never sees, a ground-truth `fix.patch`, and a scripted
  `wrong.patch` that must be rejected. A derived-index coherence task is the
  natural next one.
- **A non-conforming implementer.** The study's honest gap: every model tested
  writes careful code, so UNI's detection is demonstrated against scripted
  deliveries rather than against a careless model. If you have access to a weak
  or adversarial implementer, the harness already supports it
  (`UNI_AGENT_MODEL=<model> python3 run.py --agent opencode`).
- **Verifier adapters.** The shell verifier is the only executor today. A
  first-class adapter for a real runtime is a contained, well-tested change:
  `docs/writing-verifiers.md` has the interface and the `file-hash` adapter is
  the smallest example.
- **Documentation that is wrong.** A doc that describes behaviour the binary does
  not have is a bug. `docs/index.md` says which doc owns which subject.

## Out of scope on purpose

These are decisions, not oversights. A pull request adding them will be declined
until the constitution changes: orchestration and multi-agent frameworks, a
control plane, a policy engine (OPA is wired through the `PolicyProvider` trait
and UNI never reimplements one), Postgres and Protobuf in the core, and MCP or
A2A servers. See
`specs/001-uni-software-v01/spec.md` for the v0.1 boundary.

## Pull requests

Small and focused beats large and complete. For anything larger than a bug fix,
open an issue first so we can disagree about the shape before you write it. In
the pull request, say what would have to be true for the change to be wrong
(that is the useful review question), and include the exact command you ran when
the answer is not obvious from the diff.

## Security

Please do not open a public issue for a vulnerability. See `SECURITY.md`.

## Licence

UNI is dual licensed under MIT or Apache-2.0, at your option, and contributions
are accepted under the same terms. By opening a pull request you confirm you
wrote the change and that you have the right to submit it under that licence.
