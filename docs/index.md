| [specification.md](specification.md) | grammar, canonical IR, behavior contract |
| [current-status.md](current-status.md) | current release, CI evidence, measured results, known limits |
| [REPORT-2026-09-14.md](REPORT-2026-09-14.md) | historical September 2026 snapshot; not current status |
| [DEEP-ANALYSIS-2026-09-14.md](DEEP-ANALYSIS-2026-09-14.md) | earlier audit at v0.18, superseded; kept as the record of how two real bugs were found |

The behavior guides describe the binary built from the current source
(`cargo build --release`, `./target/release/uni`). Dated reports are historical
records of the revision named in each file. When in doubt, run the current
binary: what executes beats what a doc describes. Constitution:
`../constitution.md`. Spec source: `../specs/001-uni-software-v01/spec.md`.

## Stale evidence

- [The check, in the pull request](flagship-check.md)
- [Why a proof stopped applying](decisions.md#why-a-proof-stopped-applying)
- [Stale Evidence Benchmark, 2026-09-14](../experiments/stale-bench/RESULTS-2026-09-14.md)

## Verified identity (A3)

- [The assurance scale, and how a token earns A3](decisions.md)
- [End-to-end proof, run against the built binary](../crates/uni-cli/tests/cli_identity.rs)
- [Registry keys for `[identities]`](verification.md)
- [**Live, against a real issuer**: GitHub Actions OIDC, run unattended](../examples/identity-github-actions/README.md)
  (`.github/workflows/identity-live.yml`; the scheduled workflow is the current proof)
- [Worked example: Google, needs a human-minted token](../examples/identity-google/README.md)
