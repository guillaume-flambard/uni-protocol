**An agent saying DONE is not evidence. Verify the outcome.**

```
INTENT → CLAIMS → EVIDENCE → POLICY → DECISION
```

Rust workspace, single CLI binary `uni`. Deterministic. Filesystem-only. No cloud required.

> Developer Preview. The latest published binary is v0.9.4. See
> [current status](docs/current-status.md) for what is shipped, what is measured,
> and what is still deliberately out of scope.

## Quickstart

Prerequisites: Git, a stable Rust toolchain, and the build tools required by
your project.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/guillaume-flambard/uni-protocol.git
cd uni-protocol
cargo build --release
./target/release/uni verify examples/hello/hello.uni
./target/release/uni report
```

That example runs `cargo check` through the trusted registry and records the
evidence under `.uni/`. To start in another repository, follow the complete
[quickstart](docs/quickstart.md). A fresh `uni init` uses Cargo commands as its
starter registry; replace those entries for Python, Node, or another stack.

## Capability map (v0.9)

| Area | Command | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| Contract | `uni init` | creates `.uni/{config.toml,contracts,evidence,decisions,artifacts,policies} + uni/intents` |
| | `uni compile | inspect` | `.uni` DSL → canonical JSON IR (schema `schemas/uni.schema.json`) |
| | `uni import-speckit <dir>` | Spec Kit spec.md/plan.md → **candidate** DSL for human review |
| | `uni lint <contract>` | preflight without execution (coverage, registry refs, duplicates, selector bindings, pinned test names) |
| Evidence | `uni verify <contract>` | runs trusted-registry verifiers; incremental, git-+content-bound evidence; STALE on commit or watched-file change |
| | `uni explain` | claims table + per-claim evidence detail (PRD §16 UX) |
| Policy | `.uni/policies/*.toml` | reject_on_invalid, escalate_on_stale/missing, min_verified_ratio (deterministic) |
| Decision | - | truth table → policy → ACCEPTED/REJECTED/EVIDENCE_REQUIRED/ESCALATED |
| Audit | `uni report` | byte-stable CI/PR view (`GitHub step summary` ready) |
| | `uni events` | append-only journal with `uni.*` attributes; `--otlp` emits OTLP/JSON, `--all` reads archives |
| Health | `uni doctor` | workspace healthcheck (git, registry, policies, writability) |
| Packs | `uni pack list` / `uni pack template <pack> <name>` | Domain Packs: reusable claim templates (`packs/software`) |
| Execute | `uni run <contract> -- <command>` | runs your executor (any agent, any tool), then verifies; the exit code is the decision's |
| Work order | `uni brief <contract>` | deterministic agent handoff: claims + exact evidence required (markdown/json, byte-stable) |
| Authorization | `uni bind` / `uni bindings` | VerifierBindings for REQUIRE-carrying verifications (human act, journaled) |
| Identity | `UNI_IDENTITY_TOKEN` + `[identities]` | verifies a signed JWT against a registry-pinned issuer (JWKS offline), lifting an independent proof from A3-D to A3 |
| Transport | `uni bundle export` / `uni bundle verify` | audit surface as JSONL with per-record sha256; verify is offline and read-only |
| Study | `experiments/study-50/` | harness + metrics (agent self-report vs UNI vs human) |

Stack independence verified in CI: `examples/` covers Rust, Python (unittest),
Node (`node --test`), and a `file-hash` artifact digest. CI matrix:
ubuntu, macos, windows for the core; POSIX-shell examples gated to Linux.
Release workflow builds five cross-compiled targets; the composite action in
`adapters/github/` downloads the matching release binary (no build).

## DSL (closed vocabulary v0.1)

`VERSION DOMAIN INTENT GOAL CLAIM REQUIRE ENSURE INVARIANT FORBID VERIFY ACCEPT REJECT ESCALATE`

Verbatim from `examples/booking/booking.uni`:

```
VERSION 0.1
DOMAIN software
INTENT booking.cancel
GOAL
  Cancel a confirmed booking safely.
CLAIM booking-state REQUIRED
  ENSURE booking.status == cancelled
CLAIM inventory REQUIRED
  ENSURE inventory.available == inventory.before + booking.seats
INVARIANT ledger-consistency CRITICAL
  ENSURE ledger.balance == expected.balance
VERIFY booking-state
  USING test.true
VERIFY inventory
  USING test.true
VERIFY ledger-consistency
  USING test.true
ACCEPT WHEN
  required_claims == VERIFIED
  AND critical_failures == 0
```

Every claim carries its own `VERIFY`, the invariant included: `uni lint` fails
otherwise. The verifier names resolve through the trusted registry, never
through the contract.

## Trusted registry (contracts are untrusted)

```toml
[verifiers]
"mini.tests" = "cargo test"

[verifiers."forbid.dirty-write"]
run = "! grep -Rn 'EVIL_WRITE' examples/forbid/sources.txt"
expect_not = "EVIL_WRITE"
files = ["examples/forbid/sources.txt"]
timeout = 30
```

`expect` = output must contain; `expect_not` = output must not contain; `files` = content-bound
evidence invalidation by SHA-256 over watched files.

## Documentation

Start with [current status](docs/current-status.md), which separates shipped
behavior, measured evidence, and known limits.

Start at [docs/index.md](docs/index.md): why UNI, quickstart, language,
claims, evidence, verification, decisions, GitHub, writing verifiers,
specification.

The dated [September 2026 report](docs/REPORT-2026-09-14.md) is kept as a
historical snapshot. It is not the current project status.

## Dogfood & tests

```bash
cargo test                  # 158 tests incl. property-based decision determinism
./target/release/uni verify examples/hello/hello.uni && echo OK
```

Evidence so far, with the limits kept beside the result:

- **The check, in the pull request**: a drifted proof lands as an inline
  annotation on the file that moved. [docs/flagship-check.md](docs/flagship-check.md)
- **Stale Evidence Benchmark**, 100 manufactured drift scenarios with no model
  involved: on the 70 where the artifact stopped satisfying the claims, an
  exit-code CI stayed green 50 times, a cached CI 70 times, UNI 0 times. UNI
  detection 86 percent (100 percent in every detectable category), false-stale 0
  percent. [experiments/stale-bench/RESULTS-2026-09-14.md](experiments/stale-bench/RESULTS-2026-09-14.md)
- **Reviewed real-agent study**, corrected sample n=6: 0 false accepts and 1
  false reject. H1/H2 (UNI beats an honest agent's self-report) are **not**
  supported. An older self-report column was invalid because the harness
  asserted DONE on the agent's behalf; those rows cannot be repaired, and the
  report says so.
  [experiments/study-50/RESULTS-2026-09-14.md](experiments/study-50/RESULTS-2026-09-14.md)
- **Hidden owner invariants**, on two multi-file tasks: scripted plausible
  deliveries report DONE and keep their own tests green, while UNI rejects the
  property the implementer never saw. This proves the mechanism on these
  fixtures, not a population-level failure rate for coding models.
  [Adversarial arm](experiments/study-50/RESULTS-2026-09-19-adversarial-arm.md)
- **Drift after verification**, on the same two tasks: a correct revision is
  verified, later code moves, prior evidence becomes stale, and the delivered
  revision is re-verified and rejected.

## Contributing

Issues and pull requests are welcome. GitHub Issues is the public coordination
surface. Start with
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md): it covers the one workflow worth knowing
(contract first, then `uni verify`), how to write a verifier adapter, and the
house rule that every claim is proven by a verifier rather than asserted in
prose. Check the existing issues first. If none matches, open a focused proposal
with the outcome you want and how it could be proved.

The project has a single binary with no cloud dependency, and its integration
tests run the real CLI on real files. Please also read the
[Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Constitution

`constitution.md` - UNI is the outcome assurance layer. LLMs propose, humans/policies authorize, verifiers prove, UNI decides. Spec source: `specs/001-uni-software-v01/spec.md`.
